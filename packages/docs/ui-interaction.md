# Interacting with the Lens UI

This document provides a guide on how to navigate and interact with the Lens UI, a dashboard designed to monitor requests, database queries, cache operations, and exceptions within your application.

## 1. Navigation

The Lens UI is organized into several main sections, accessible via the sidebar on the left.

*   **Requests:** View all incoming HTTP requests.
*   **Queries:** Monitor database queries executed by your application.
*   **Cache:** Track cache hits, misses, writes, and deletes.
*   **Exceptions:** Review application errors and their stack traces.

### 1.1. Header

The header, located at the top of the page, displays:
*   **Application Name:** Click on the application name to return to the main Requests list.
*   **Delete Button:** A trash icon button. Clicking this will open a confirmation modal to **permanently delete all recorded entries** across all categories (requests, queries, cache, exceptions). Use with caution.
*   **Mobile Menu Toggle:** On smaller screens, a menu icon (`â˜°`) will appear to toggle the sidebar visibility.

## 2. Viewing Requests
