# Quick Start

Welcome to Lens! This guide will get you set up in just a few minutes.

Lens works by plugging into your existing framework using a dedicated **adapter**. The first step is to choose the right one for your project.

## 1. Choose Your Framework

Select your framework below to see its detailed installation guide.

<div class="vp-doc">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../adapters/express/installation">Express</a></li>
    <li><a href="../adapters/adonis/installation">AdonisJS</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

Each guide provides a complete, copy-pasteable example to get you started.

## 2. What's Next?

After successfully setting up your adapter, you're ready to dive deeper into Lens's capabilities. Here are some recommended next steps:

*   **Explore Handlers:** Learn how to configure and use various handlers for requests, queries, and caching to get the most out of Lens's monitoring features.
