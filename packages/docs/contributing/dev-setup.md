# Contributing to Lens

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Lens! It's people like you that make Lens such a great tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lensjs/lens.git
    cd lens
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    This project uses `bun` as a package manager and `lerna` with workspaces. Running `bun install` at the root will install dependencies for all packages and link them together.

    ```bash
    npm install && npx install husky
    ```
3.  **Build all packages:**

    This command will build all the packages in the correct order.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Run the example application:**

    This will start the Express server with hot-reloading.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You can visit `http://localhost:3000/add-user` to trigger a database query that will be captured by Lens.

1.  Make your changes in the appropriate package(s).
2.  If you are working on the UI, you can run the UI dev server:

4.  Commit your changes following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
